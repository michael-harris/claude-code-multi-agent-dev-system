# Development History Archive

This directory contains archived development documents from the creation and evolution of the multi-agent-dev-system plugin.

## Purpose

These documents are preserved for:
- **Historical context** - Understanding how the plugin was designed and built
- **Architectural decisions** - Documenting key choices and trade-offs
- **Learning reference** - Examples of AI-assisted plugin development

## Important Note

These documents contain references to old paths and repository names from the development process:
- **Old path**: `../claude-code-multi-agent-dev-system/` (referenced as a separate directory)
- **Old repository name**: `multi-agent-claude-workflow`
- **Development context**: These files were created during plugin development when the structure was different

**These references are historical and should NOT be updated.** They accurately reflect the development state at the time they were written.

## Current State

The plugin is now located in the root directory of this repository:
- **Current repository**: `claude-code-multi-agent-dev-system`
