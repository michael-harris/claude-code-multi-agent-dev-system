## 🚀 Next Steps

### Step 1: Create Your First PRD (10-15 minutes)

```bash
/prd
```

The PRD generator will ask you:
1. **Technology Stack** (ASKED FIRST)
   - "What integrations do you need?" → Recommends Python or TypeScript
2. **Problem & Solution**
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who are your users?
3. **Requirements**
   - Must-have features
   - Success criteria
4. **Constraints**
   - Timeline, budget, security needs

**Output:** `docs/planning/PROJECT_PRD.yaml`

### Step 2: Generate Tasks & Sprints (2-5 minutes)

```bash
/planning
```

Claude will:
- Launch task-graph-analyzer agent to break PRD into 10-30 tasks
- Assign task types (fullstack, backend, frontend, python-generic)
- Analyze dependencies
- Launch sprint-planner agent to group tasks into 2-5 sprints
- Balance workload across sprints

**Output:** `docs/planning/tasks/TASK-*.yaml` and `docs/sprints/SPRINT-*.yaml` files

### Step 3: Execute Your First Sprint (Claude Orchestrates!)

```bash
/sprint SPRINT-001
```

Claude will:
- Read sprint plan and execute all tasks in dependency order
- Launch T1 (Haiku) agents for iterations 1-2 (cost-optimized)
- Track iteration counts and validation results manually
- Switch to T2 (Sonnet) for iteration 3+ if needed (enhanced quality)
- Ensure all acceptance criteria pass (100% quality gates)
- Report progress after each task

**Expected:** 70% of tasks complete with T1 only, 30% require T2

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### During Planning (15-20 minutes of your time)
- Interactive Q&A for PRD
- Automatic task breakdown
- Automatic sprint organization
- Complete roadmap ready

### During Execution (Fully automated)
**Per Task:**
- Iteration 1 (T1): Full implementation with all agents
- Validation: Check all acceptance criteria
- If FAIL: Iteration 2 (T1) fixes specific gaps
- If still FAIL: Iteration 3+ (T2) enhanced quality
- If PASS: Task complete

**Per Sprint:**
- Multiple tasks execute (parallel where possible)
- Real-time status tracking
- Tier usage statistics (T1 vs T2)
- Quality metrics and reports
- All deliverables validated

### Cost Optimization with T1/T2 System
- **70% of tasks:** Complete with T1 (Haiku) only - cost-effective
- **30% of tasks:** Require T2 (Sonnet) for complex scenarios
- **Result:** 60% cost savings vs all-Sonnet approach
- **Quality:** Same high-quality outcomes, automatic escalation

## 💡 Example First Project

**Simple task management app:**

```bash
# Planning (20 minutes)
/prd generate
# Answer: Python + FastAPI (simple CRUD, no ML)
# Define: Users, tasks, CRUD operations

/planning analyze
# Generates: 12 tasks

/planning sprints
# Creates: 3 sprints

# Execution (Automated)
/sprint execute SPRINT-001
# Builds: Auth, database, basic API (T1 sufficient for most)
# Time: 6-8 hours automated

/sprint execute SPRINT-002
# Builds: Task CRUD, dashboard UI (some T2 for complex UI)
# Time: 8-10 hours automated

/sprint execute SPRINT-003
# Builds: Polish, docs, deployment (T1 sufficient)
# Time: 4-6 hours automated
```

**Total time:** ~3 days automated, ~1 hour of your time
