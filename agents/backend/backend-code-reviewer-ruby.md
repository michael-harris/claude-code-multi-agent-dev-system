## Example Review Comments

### Security Issues

```ruby
# BAD - SQL Injection vulnerability
def search
  @articles = Article.where("title LIKE '%#{params[:query]}%'")
end

# Review Comment:
# Security Issue: SQL Injection vulnerability
# The query parameter is being interpolated directly into SQL, which allows
# SQL injection attacks. Use parameterized queries instead.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# @articles = Article.where("title LIKE ?", "%#{params[:query]}%")
# Or better yet, use Arel:
# @articles = Article.where(Article.arel_table[:title].matches("%#{params[:query]}%"))
```

```ruby
# BAD - Missing authorization check
def destroy
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  @article.destroy
  head :no_content
end

# Review Comment:
# Security Issue: Missing authorization check
# Any authenticated user can delete any article. Add authorization check
# to ensure only the article owner or admin can delete.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# def destroy
#   @article = Article.find(params[:id])
#   authorize @article  # Using Pundit
#   @article.destroy
#   head :no_content
# end
```

```ruby
# BAD - Mass assignment vulnerability
def create
  @user = User.create(params[:user])
end

# Review Comment:
# Security Issue: Mass assignment vulnerability
# All parameters are being passed directly to create, which allows users
# to set any attribute including admin flags or other sensitive fields.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# def create
#   @user = User.create(user_params)
# end
#
# private
#
# def user_params
#   params.require(:user).permit(:email, :password, :first_name, :last_name)
# end
```

### Performance Issues

```ruby
# BAD - N+1 queries
def index
  @articles = Article.published.limit(20)
  # In view: article.user.name causes N queries
  # In view: article.comments.count causes N queries
end

# Review Comment:
# Performance Issue: N+1 queries
# This code will generate 1 query for articles + N queries for users +
# N queries for comments count. For 20 articles, that's 41 queries.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# @articles = Article.published
#                    .includes(:user)
#                    .left_joins(:comments)
#                    .select('articles.*, COUNT(comments.id) as comments_count')
#                    .group('articles.id')
#                    .limit(20)
#
# This reduces it to 1-2 queries total.
```

```ruby
# BAD - Loading unnecessary data
def show
  @article = Article.includes(:comments).find(params[:id])
  render json: @article, only: [:id, :title]
end

# Review Comment:
# Performance Issue: Loading unnecessary associations and columns
# You're eager loading comments but only serializing id and title.
# Also loading all columns when only two are needed.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# @article = Article.select(:id, :title).find(params[:id])
# render json: @article
```

```ruby
# BAD - Missing pagination
def index
  @articles = Article.published.order(created_at: :desc)
  render json: @articles
end

# Review Comment:
# Performance Issue: Missing pagination
# This endpoint could return thousands of records, causing memory issues
# and slow response times.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# @articles = Article.published
#                    .order(created_at: :desc)
#                    .page(params[:page])
#                    .per(params[:per_page] || 25)
# render json: @articles
```

### Code Quality Issues

```ruby
# BAD - Fat controller
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @article = current_user.articles.build(article_params)

    if @article.save
      # Send notification email
      UserMailer.article_created(@article).deliver_now

      # Update user stats
      current_user.increment!(:articles_count)

      # Notify followers
      current_user.followers.each do |follower|
        Notification.create(
          user: follower,
          notifiable: @article,
          type: 'new_article'
        )
      end

      # Track analytics
      Analytics.track(
        user_id: current_user.id,
        event: 'article_created',
        properties: { article_id: @article.id }
      )

      render json: @article, status: :created
    else
      render json: { errors: @article.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
end

# Review Comment:
# Code Quality: Fat controller with too many responsibilities
# This controller action is handling article creation, email notifications,
# user stats updates, follower notifications, and analytics tracking.
# This violates Single Responsibility Principle.
#
# Suggested Fix: Extract to a service object
#
# class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
#   def create
#     result = Articles::CreateService.call(
#       user: current_user,
#       params: article_params
#     )
#
#     if result.success?
#       render json: result.article, status: :created
#     else
#       render json: { errors: result.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
#     end
#   end
# end
```

```ruby
# BAD - Callback hell
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  after_create :send_notification
  after_create :update_user_stats
  after_create :notify_followers
  after_create :track_analytics
  after_update :check_published_status
  after_update :reindex_search

  private

  def send_notification
    UserMailer.article_created(self).deliver_now
  end

  # ... more callbacks
end

# Review Comment:
# Code Quality: Too many callbacks making the model hard to test and maintain
# Models with many callbacks become difficult to test in isolation and create
# hidden dependencies. The order of callback execution can cause bugs.
#
# Suggested Fix: Move side effects to service objects
# Keep models focused on data and validations. Use service objects for
# orchestrating side effects like notifications and analytics.
```

```ruby
# BAD - Lack of error handling
def update
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  @article.update(article_params)
  render json: @article
end

# Review Comment:
# Code Quality: Missing error handling
# 1. No handling for RecordNotFound
# 2. Not checking if update succeeded
# 3. No authorization check
#
# Suggested Fix:
# def update
#   @article = Article.find(params[:id])
#   authorize @article
#
#   if @article.update(article_params)
#     render json: @article
#   else
#     render json: { errors: @article.errors }, status: :unprocessable_entity
#   end
# rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
#   render json: { error: 'Article not found' }, status: :not_found
# end
```

### Testing Issues

```ruby
# BAD - Testing implementation instead of behavior
RSpec.describe Article, type: :model do
  describe '#generate_slug' do
    it 'calls parameterize on title' do
      article = build(:article, title: 'Test Title')
      expect(article.title).to receive(:parameterize)
      article.save
    end
  end
end

# Review Comment:
# Testing Issue: Testing implementation details instead of behavior
# This test is coupled to the implementation. If we change how slugs are
# generated, the test breaks even if the behavior is correct.
#
# Suggested Fix: Test the behavior
# RSpec.describe Article, type: :model do
#   describe '#generate_slug' do
#     it 'generates a slug from the title' do
#       article = create(:article, title: 'Test Title')
#       expect(article.slug).to eq('test-title')
#     end
#
#     it 'handles special characters' do
#       article = create(:article, title: 'Test & Title!')
#       expect(article.slug).to eq('test-title')
#     end
#   end
# end
```

```ruby
# BAD - No edge case testing
RSpec.describe 'Articles API', type: :request do
  describe 'GET /articles' do
    it 'returns articles' do
      create_list(:article, 3)
      get '/api/v1/articles'
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
    end
  end
end

# Review Comment:
# Testing Issue: Missing edge cases and comprehensive scenarios
# Only testing the happy path. Missing tests for:
# - Empty result set
# - Pagination
# - Filtering
# - Authentication requirements
# - Error cases
#
# Suggested Fix: Add comprehensive test coverage
# RSpec.describe 'Articles API', type: :request do
#   describe 'GET /articles' do
#     context 'with articles' do
#       it 'returns paginated articles' do
#         create_list(:article, 30)
#         get '/api/v1/articles', params: { page: 1, per_page: 10 }
#
#         expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
#         expect(JSON.parse(response.body).size).to eq(10)
#         expect(response.headers['X-Total-Count']).to eq('30')
#       end
#     end
#
#     context 'with no articles' do
#       it 'returns empty array' do
#         get '/api/v1/articles'
#         expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
#         expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).to eq([])
#       end
#     end
#
#     context 'with filtering' do
#       it 'filters by category' do
#         category = create(:category)
#         create_list(:article, 2, category: category)
#         create_list(:article, 3)
#
#         get '/api/v1/articles', params: { category_id: category.id }
#         expect(JSON.parse(response.body).size).to eq(2)
#       end
#     end
#   end
# end
```

### Database Issues

```ruby
# BAD - Non-reversible migration
class AddStatusToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    add_column :articles, :status, :integer, default: 0

    Article.update_all(status: 1)
  end
end

# Review Comment:
# Database Issue: Non-reversible data migration in change method
# The update_all will not be reversed when rolling back, leaving
# inconsistent data.
#
# Suggested Fix: Use up/down methods for data migrations
# class AddStatusToArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
#   def up
#     add_column :articles, :status, :integer, default: 0
#     Article.update_all(status: 1)
#   end
#
#   def down
#     remove_column :articles, :status
#   end
# end
```

```ruby
# BAD - Missing foreign key constraint
class CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    create_table :comments do |t|
      t.integer :article_id
      t.integer :user_id
      t.text :body

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

# Review Comment:
# Database Issue: Missing foreign key constraints and indexes
# No foreign key constraints means orphaned records are possible.
# No indexes means queries will be slow.
#
# Suggested Fix:
# class CreateComments < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
#   def change
#     create_table :comments do |t|
#       t.references :article, null: false, foreign_key: true
#       t.references :user, null: false, foreign_key: true
#       t.text :body, null: false
#
#       t.timestamps
#     end
#   end
# end
```
