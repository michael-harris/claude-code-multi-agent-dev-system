## 2. Fixed Issues

### Bash Template Syntax Removed (12 Files Fixed)

**Problem:** Agent files contained bash template syntax like:
```bash
$(echo $file | grep -o 't[12]' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z')
$(if [[ $file == *t1 ]]; then echo "claude-haiku-4-5"; else echo "claude-sonnet-4-5"; fi)
```

This was an attempt to DRY up T1/T2 agent definitions but made files invalid for plugin use.

**Fixed Files:**
1. `database-developer-python-t1.md` ✅
2. `database-developer-python-t2.md` ✅
3. `database-developer-typescript-t1.md` ✅
4. `database-developer-typescript-t2.md` ✅
5. `api-developer-python-t1.md` ✅
6. `api-developer-python-t2.md` ✅
7. `api-developer-typescript-t1.md` ✅
8. `api-developer-typescript-t2.md` ✅
9. `frontend-developer-t1.md` ✅
10. `frontend-developer-t2.md` ✅
11. `python-developer-generic-t1.md` ✅
12. `python-developer-generic-t2.md` ✅

**Solution Applied:**
- Each T1 file now explicitly states: `**Model:** claude-haiku-4-5`, `**Tier:** T1`, `(cost-optimized)`
- Each T2 file now explicitly states: `**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5`, `**Tier:** T2`, `(enhanced quality)` + T2 Enhanced Capabilities section
- All files are now valid static markdown

## 3. Command Structure Analysis

### `/multi-agent:prd` Command
**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive PRD through interactive interview
**Architecture:** Direct invocation of `prd-generator` agent
**Flow:**
```
User: /multi-agent:prd
  ↓
Main Claude → prd-generator agent (Sonnet)
  ↓
Output: docs/planning/PROJECT_PRD.yaml
```

**Key Feature:** Technology stack selection FIRST (based on integrations)

### `/multi-agent:planning` Command
**Purpose:** Break PRD into tasks and organize into sprints
**Architecture:** Sequential orchestration of 2 agents
**Flow:**
```
User: /multi-agent:planning
  ↓
Main Claude orchestrates:
  1. task-graph-analyzer (Sonnet) → Creates TASK-XXX.yaml files
  2. sprint-planner (Sonnet) → Creates SPRINT-XXX.yaml files
```

### `/multi-agent:sprint` Command ⚠️ **IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL FINDING**
**Purpose:** Execute complete sprint with quality loops
**Architecture:** **Manual orchestration by main Claude instance**

**Current Implementation:**
```
User: /multi-agent:sprint SPRINT-001
  ↓
Main Claude reads sprint definition
  ↓
Main Claude DIRECTLY orchestrates all specialized agents
  (database-designer → database-developer → api-designer → etc.)
  ↓
Main Claude handles T1→T2 escalation logic
  ↓
Main Claude calls requirements-validator as quality gate
```

**⚠️ Architectural Note:**
- The `sprint-orchestrator.md` agent file EXISTS but is NOT launched
- The `/multi-agent:sprint` command contains the orchestration instructions
- This is the "pragmatic orchestration" approach mentioned in the system
- `sprint-orchestrator.md` has commands (`/multi-agent:sprint execute`, `/multi-agent:sprint status`) that don't match actual usage

**Decision Needed for Plugin:**
1. **Option A:** Keep sprint-orchestrator as a launchable agent (requires updating /multi-agent:sprint command to launch it)
2. **Option B:** Remove sprint-orchestrator.md from plugin since it's not actually used
3. **Option C:** Document it as "reference architecture" but not as a launchable agent

**Recommendation:** Option A - Update `/multi-agent:sprint` to actually launch sprint-orchestrator agent for consistency

## 4. Model Assignment Analysis

### Opus (claude-opus-4-1) - High-Value Decisions [6 agents]
- ✅ `database-designer` - Schema design requires architectural thinking
- ✅ `api-designer` - API contract design is critical
- ✅ `frontend-designer` - Component architecture decisions
- ✅ `requirements-validator` - Quality gate requires thorough analysis
- ✅ `security-auditor` - Security requires deep analysis
- ✅ `sprint-orchestrator` - High-level coordination (though not currently launched)

**Cost Impact:** Used for design phase and quality gates - appropriate

### Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5) - Balanced Quality [13 agents]
- Planning: `prd-generator`, `task-graph-analyzer`, `sprint-planner`
- Orchestration: `task-orchestrator`
- T2 Developers: All 6 T2 implementation agents
- Quality: `test-writer`, `documentation-coordinator`
- Reviewers: All 3 code reviewer agents

**Cost Impact:** Used for complex implementation and quality assurance - appropriate

### Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5) - Cost-Optimized [6 agents]
- All T1 developers:
  - `database-developer-{python,typescript}-t1`
  - `api-developer-{python,typescript}-t1`
  - `frontend-developer-t1`
  - `python-developer-generic-t1`

**Cost Impact:** Used for straightforward implementations - excellent cost optimization

### Cost Optimization Strategy: EXCELLENT
- T1 (Haiku) tries first → 2-3 iterations
- T2 (Sonnet) handles complex cases after T1 fails
- Opus only for design and critical quality gates
- **Estimated 60-70% cost savings** vs. all-Opus approach

---

## 5. Agent Quality Assessment

### Structural Completeness: ✅ EXCELLENT
Every agent has:
- ✅ Clear model specification
- ✅ Tier designation (where applicable)
- ✅ Purpose statement
- ✅ Role definition
- ✅ Detailed responsibilities
- ✅ Quality checks
- ✅ Output specifications
- ✅ Technology-specific guidelines

### Content Quality Analysis

#### Strengths
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns** - Each agent has distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
2. **Technology-Specific Guidance** - Python agents know FastAPI/Django, TypeScript agents know Express/NestJS
3. **T1/T2 Differentiation** - Clear capability differences documented
4. **Quality Focus** - Every agent has explicit quality checks
5. **Security-First** - Security considerations throughout (esp. security-auditor)
6. **Accessibility-First** - Frontend agents have WCAG 2.1 compliance built in
7. **Detailed Output Specs** - Agents know exactly what files to create

#### Minor Optimization Opportunities

**1. PRD Generator Model Assignment**
- **Current:** Sonnet (314 lines, most complex agent)
- **Assessment:** Appropriate - requires nuanced understanding of requirements
- **No change recommended**

**2. Requirements Validator Location**
- **Current:** `orchestration/requirements-validator.md`
- **Alternative:** `quality/requirements-validator.md`
- **Assessment:** Current location is correct - it's an orchestration quality gate
- **No change recommended**

**3. Sprint Orchestrator Status**
- **Current:** Defined but not launched by `/multi-agent:sprint` command
- **Issue:** Mismatch between agent definition and actual usage
- **Recommendation:** Update `/multi-agent:sprint` command to launch the agent for architectural consistency

**4. Task Orchestrator vs Sprint Orchestrator**
- **task-orchestrator:** Sonnet - Handles single task workflow
- **sprint-orchestrator:** Opus - Handles entire sprint (but not launched)
- **Assessment:** If sprint-orchestrator were used, Opus is appropriate
- **Recommendation:** If converting to plugin, decide on orchestration model

---

## 6. Plugin Conversion Plan Updates

### Changes to Original Plan

#### 1. Add PRD Generator (28th Agent)
```json
{
  "id": "planning:prd-generator",
  "name": "PRD Generator",
  "description": "Interactive PRD creation with technology stack selection",
  "file": "agents/multi-agent:planning/multi-agent:prd-generator.md",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "category": "planning"
}
```

#### 2. Decide on Sprint Orchestrator
**Options:**

**A. Launch as Agent (Recommended)**
Update `/multi-agent:sprint` command to:
```javascript
Task(
  subagent_type="multi-agent-dev-system:orchestration:sprint-orchestrator",
  model="opus",
  prompt=`Execute SPRINT-${sprintId} with full quality loops`
)
```

**B. Document as Reference**
- Keep in plugin as documentation
- Mark as "reference architecture, not launchable"
- `/multi-agent:sprint` command continues manual orchestration

**C. Remove from Plugin**
- Remove sprint-orchestrator.md
- Only include task-orchestrator
- `/multi-agent:sprint` remains command-only (no agent)

**RECOMMENDATION: Option A** - Consistency and proper agent-based architecture

#### 3. Requirements Validator Category
- **Keep in:** `orchestration` category
- **Reasoning:** It's a gate in the orchestration flow, not a general quality agent
- **No change needed**
