## Understanding Agents

Agents are AI personas with specialized knowledge and capabilities. Each agent is defined in a Markdown file that contains:

- **Role**: What the agent does
- **Capabilities**: What the agent can do
- **Instructions**: How the agent should behave
- **Output Format**: Expected response structure

### How Agents are Selected

1. **Trigger Matching**: Keywords in user request match agent triggers
2. **Weight Scoring**: Higher weight = higher priority when multiple match
3. **Model Assignment**: Each agent specifies its model (haiku, sonnet, or opus) in YAML frontmatter
4. **Context Awareness**: Current phase influences agent selection
5. **Escalation**: Orchestrators handle model escalation via LLM instructions (sonnet -> opus after 2 failures, opus -> Bug Council after 3 failures)

## Agent Categories

| Category | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `orchestration/` | `agents/orchestration/` | Task loops, sprint orchestration, coordination |
| `planning/` | `agents/planning/` | PRD generation, sprint planning, task analysis |
| `backend/` | `agents/backend/` | API design, development, and code review |
| `frontend/` | `agents/frontend/` | UI design, development, and code review |
| `database/` | `agents/database/` | Schema design and language-specific DB development |
| `quality/` | `agents/quality/` | Testing, security auditing, performance |
| `diagnosis/` | `agents/diagnosis/` | Bug Council root cause analysis |
| `devops/` | `agents/devops/` | CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform |
| `mobile/` | `agents/mobile/` | iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native |
| `security/` | `agents/security/` | Language-specific security auditing |
| `scripting/` | `agents/scripting/` | Shell and PowerShell scripting |
| `ux/` | `agents/ux/` | Design systems, accessibility, UX |

## Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Identify the Need

Before creating an agent, ask:
- Does an existing agent cover this domain?
- Is this specialized enough to warrant a dedicated agent?
- What unique value does this agent provide?

### Step 2: Choose Category and Model

**Models (set in YAML frontmatter):**
- **haiku**: Cost-optimized for straightforward, well-defined tasks (weight: 70-100)
- **sonnet**: Default for most operations, good balance of capability and cost (weight: 50-80)
- **opus**: Required for complex reasoning, architecture, and security-critical tasks (weight: 30-60)

### Step 3: Create the Agent File

```bash
# Create from template
cp agents/templates/base-agent.md agents/specialized/my-agent.md
```

### Step 4: Define the Agent

Edit the file with your agent definition (see structure below).

### Step 5: Register in agent-registry.json

Add entry to the agents array.

### Step 6: Test

Run tests to verify agent selection and behavior.

## Agent Structure

```markdown
# Agent Name

## Role

A clear, one-sentence description of what this agent does.

## Capabilities

- Capability 1: Brief description
- Capability 2: Brief description
- Capability 3: Brief description

    "field1": "value",
    "field2": "value"
  },
  "next_steps": ["step1", "step2"]
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Description of what went wrong",
  "suggestions": ["suggestion1", "suggestion2"]
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

**Input:**
```
User request here
```

**Output:**
```
Agent response here
```

**Input:**
```
Complex user request
```

**Output:**
```
Detailed agent response
```

## Integration Points

This agent interacts with:
- **Agent X**: For capability Y
- **Agent Z**: When condition W

## Escalation

Escalate to a more capable model when:
- Condition requiring escalation 1
- Condition requiring escalation 2

## Related Agents

- `related-agent-1`: Complementary capability
- `related-agent-2`: Alternative for different context
```

### Section Guidelines

#### Role
- One clear sentence
- Start with action verb
- Be specific about domain

**Good:** "Analyzes TypeScript code for type safety issues and suggests fixes."
**Bad:** "Helps with TypeScript stuff."

#### Capabilities
- 3-7 bullet points
- Each starts with action verb
- Specific and measurable

#### When to Use
- Clear inclusion criteria
- Explicit exclusion criteria
- Examples of appropriate requests

#### Instructions
- Numbered steps for processes
- Clear decision points
- Specific actions, not vague guidance

#### Output Format
- JSON structure when applicable
- Include success AND error formats
- Document all fields

#### Examples
- At least 2 examples
- Cover simple and complex cases
- Show realistic input/output

## Registration

### agent-registry.json Entry

```json
{
  "id": "category:agent-name",
  "name": "My Agent Display Name",
  "description": "Brief description for selection",
  "file": "agents/category/agent-name.md",
  "model": "sonnet",
  "category": "category"
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier in `category:name` format (kebab-case) |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `description` | Yes | Brief description for selection |
| `file` | Yes | Relative path to agent markdown file |
| `model` | Yes | Model assignment: `haiku`, `sonnet`, or `opus` |
| `category` | Yes | Agent category matching directory name |

### Naming Convention

1. **ID format**: `category:name` where name does NOT repeat the category prefix
2. **Examples**: `backend:api-developer-python`, `frontend:developer`, `database:designer`
3. **File path**: Must match `agents/{category}/{name}.md`

## Testing Agents

### Manual Testing

```bash
# In Claude Code with DevTeam installed
/devteam:status

# Then make a request matching your agent's triggers
"I need help with [your domain]"
```

### Automated Testing

Create a test file:

```bash
# tests/test-agents/test-my-agent.sh

#!/bin/bash
source "$(dirname "$0")/../test-helpers.sh"

test_my_agent_triggers() {
    # Test that agent is selected for expected triggers
    local selected
    selected=$(select_agent_for_request "keyword1 in request")
    assert_equals "my-agent" "$selected" "Agent should be selected for keyword1"
}

test_my_agent_not_selected() {
    # Test that agent is NOT selected for unrelated requests
    local selected
    selected=$(select_agent_for_request "unrelated request")
    assert_not_equals "my-agent" "$selected" "Agent should not be selected"
}

run_test test_my_agent_triggers
run_test test_my_agent_not_selected
```

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Agent file passes markdown lint
- [ ] All required sections present
- [ ] Registered in agent-registry.json
- [ ] Triggers don't conflict with existing agents
- [ ] Examples are accurate
- [ ] Output format is valid JSON (if applicable)

## Best Practices

### Do

1. **Be specific** - Narrow scope is better than trying to do everything
2. **Include examples** - Real-world scenarios help users and the AI
3. **Define boundaries** - Clear "when NOT to use" prevents misuse
4. **Use structured output** - JSON format enables automation
5. **Document escalation** - Know when to hand off to stronger models
6. **Test thoroughly** - Verify trigger matching and output

### Don't

1. **Overlap with existing agents** - Check what exists first
2. **Use vague instructions** - "Be helpful" is not actionable
3. **Forget error handling** - Define what happens when things fail
4. **Skip examples** - They're essential for AI understanding
5. **Use inconsistent format** - Follow the template
6. **Create overly broad triggers** - Specificity prevents conflicts

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Vague role | AI doesn't know what to do | Be specific and actionable |
| No examples | AI guesses output format | Include 2+ concrete examples |
| Overlapping triggers | Wrong agent selected | Check existing triggers first |
| Missing constraints | Agent overreaches | Define clear boundaries |
| No error format | Failures are confusing | Document error responses |

## Advanced Topics

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Agents can invoke other agents:

```markdown
## Integration Points

When encountering [condition], delegate to:
- `test-writer`: To create test cases
- `code-reviewer`: To validate changes
```

### Model-Specific Behavior

```markdown
## Model Considerations

- **Haiku**: Use for simple, well-defined tasks
- **Sonnet**: Default for most operations
- **Opus**: Required for complex reasoning
```

### Context Awareness

```markdown
## Context Handling

Check the current phase before acting:
- In `planning`: Focus on design
- In `executing`: Focus on implementation
- In `quality_check`: Focus on validation
```

## Examples of Good Agents

Study these well-designed agents:
- `agents/orchestration/autonomous-controller.md` - Orchestration example
- `agents/quality/test-writer.md` - Testing example
- `agents/security/penetration-tester.md` - Security example

## Getting Help

- Review existing agents for patterns
- Check CONTRIBUTING.md for style guidelines
- Open an issue for guidance on complex agents
